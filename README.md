# Unit5HW

The goals of this assignment are to create a Day Planner that:

* Displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).


* Has each timeblock contain an input field and save button.


* Allows clicking a timeblock's "Save" button to store the input text in local storage, as well as allows text to persist when the application is refreshed.


* Has the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.


* Has each timeblock as color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.


* IMPORTANT: This Day Planner has been coded and designed specifically for Desktop use.
