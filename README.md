* Has each timeblock contain an input field and save button.


* Allows clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing text to persist when the application is refreshed.


* Has the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.


* Has each timeblock as color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
